This package implements active learning strategies for one-class learning.
The package has been developed as part of a benchmark suite for [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) strategies for one-class classification. For more information about this research project, see the [OCAL project](https://www.ipd.kit.edu/ocal/) website, and the companion paper.

## Installation
This package works with Julia 0.7 and Julia 1.0.
This package is not registered yet. Please use the following command to add the package with Pkg3.
```Julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/englhardt/OneClassActiveLearning.jl.git")
```

The results presented in the paper base on a previous version of the package and on Julia 0.6.
To reproduce the experiment results from the paper, use the old package manager (with Pkg.clone) and checkout OneClassActiveLearning.jl at tag `v1.0`.

## Overview
[One-class classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-class_classification) learn to identify if objects belong to a specific class, often used for outlier detection.
The package uses the one-class classifiers implemented in [SVDD.jl](https://github.com/englhardt/SVDD.jl).
The package implements a full active-learning cycle.
This includes the setup with data loading, splitting and setting up the initial labels.
Then it includes several active learning strategies for one-class learning.
All the results are stored in `.json` files.

The script in `example` gives a jump start on how to use this package.

### Data and initial pool init_strategies

The package offers multiple data splitting strategies.
- *(Sh)* Split holdout: Model fitting and query selection on the training split, and testing on a distinct holdout sample.
- *(Sf)* Split full: Model fitting, query selection and testing on the full data set.
- *(Si)* Split inlier: Like Sf, but model fitting on labeled inliers only.

The package includes multiple strategies to initialize the initial pool before starting the active learning:
- *(Pu)* Pool unlabeled: All observations are unlabeled.
- *(Pp)* Pool percentage: Stratified proportion of labels for p percent of the observations.
- *(Pn)* Pool number: : Stratified proportion of labels for a fixed number of observations.
- *(Pa)* Pool attributes: : As many labeled inliers as number of attributes.

### Active learning strategies
This is a list of the available active learning strategies:
- Data-based query strategies
  - MinimumMarginQs and ExpectedMinimumMarginQs [1]
  - MaximumEntropyQs [1]
  - MaximumLossQs [2]
- Model-based query strategies
    - HighConfidenceQs [3]
    - DecisionBoundaryQs
- Hybrid query strategies
    - NeighborhoodBasedQs [4]
    - BoundaryNeighborCombination [5]
- Baselines
  - RandomQs
  - RandomOutlierQs

#### Extending with a new strategy

A new query strategy `NewQs` can be implemented with the following steps:

1. First create a new type `NewQs` and implement:
```Julia
qs_score(qs::NewQs, data::Array{T, 2}, pools::Dict{Symbol, Vector{Int}}) where T <: Real
```
Here, `data` is a subset of the full data set which depends on the data splitting strategy.
The current labels of the active learning cycle are in `pools` (`:U` for a unlabled, `:Lin` for labeled a inlier and `:Lout` for labeled a outlier observation).
The argument `pools` contains a dictionary mapping from the different labels to indices in `data`.
The output of the function must be a score array, where the score at index `i` belongs to observation `i` in `data`.
The framework then chooses the observation with the highest score that is still unlabeled.

2. Add a call to the constructor of `NewQs` in `initialize_qs` (`src/QueryStrategies/qs_utils.jl`).

3. Export `NewQs` in `src/QueryStrategies/QueryStrategies.jl`.
